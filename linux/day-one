### 🐧 Key Features of Linux

#1. Open Source**

- The source code is freely available.
- Anyone can view, modify, and distribute it.
- Backed by huge communities and companies (Red Hat, Canonical, Google, etc.).

#2. Multiuser**

- Multiple users can work on the system at the same time.
- Strong permission and ownership system keeps users isolated and secure.

- Strong file permissions, SELinux/AppArmor, firewalls.
- Regular updates from trusted repositories.

#5. Stability & Reliability**

- Systems can run for months or years without rebooting.
- Widely used in servers, supercomputers, and cloud infrastructure.

#6. Portability**

- Runs on many architectures: PCs, servers, ARM devices, Raspberry Pi, even mainframes.

#7. Command Line Power**

- Powerful shell (Bash, Zsh, etc.) for automation and scripting.
- Makes admin and development tasks fast and efficient.

#8. Customization**

- Highly customizable desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.).
- You can tailor everything—from the UI to the kernel.

#9. Software Management**

- Package managers (APT, YUM, DNF, Pacman) make installing/updating software easy and safe.

#10. Networking Capabilities**

- Built-in support for networking and server tools.
- Commonly used for web servers, databases, and networking devices.
